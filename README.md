# Client Detection Application

This is a simple web application designed to detect and display various client 
information such as system details, window dimensions, battery status, and 
network connectivity.

## How to Use

1. **System Information**: Upon loading the page, you'll see details about the 
operating system, language, and browser being used.
2. **Window Information**: The application also provides real-time updates on 
the current window width, height, and orientation (portrait or landscape).
3. **Battery Status**: If available, the battery level and charging status will 
be displayed. Note that this feature may not be supported on all devices.
4. **Network Status**: The application dynamically updates to indicate whether 
the device is online or offline.

## Exploring the window object

The window object in JavaScript stands for the current web page that is being
seen in a browser window. It gives access to the browserâ€™s methods and
attributes as the global object in the browser environment. The window object is
the global object in the web browser environment. It represents the current
window or frames that the JavaScript code is running in.
